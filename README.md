# Site Changes Notifier

## I created this script to track if a web page has changed, and if there are changes then an email will be sent to the email address you have set (.env file)

### To Use The Repository:

0. **Install** the repo (**npm install**)
1. fill in the **env** file and rename it
2. add the pages you want to track for changes into _/src/resources/SiteList.csv_
 
      for example: _Google, https://www.google.com_
  
3. **Run the code** (npm start or node index.js)
